    "1.Open a text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Save the file with a .py extension. In this case, save it as hello.py. Make sure you choose a location where you have write permissions.\n",

    "\n",
    ".On Windows, you can open the Command Prompt by searching for \"cmd\" in the Start menu.\n",
    ".On macOS, you can open the Terminal from the Applications folder or by searching for it in Spotlight.\n",
    ".On Linux, you can open the Terminal by searching for it in your applications or by using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Navigate to the Script's Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is on your desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "cd Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Execute the Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the Python script, use the python command followed by the script's filename:\n",
    "\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will run your hello.py script, and you should see the output \"Hello, World!\" displayed in the command prompt or terminal.\n",

    "If you have multiple Python versions installed, you may need to specify the version you want to use. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python3 hello.py\n",
